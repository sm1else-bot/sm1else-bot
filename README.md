- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, After creating a GitHub account back when I was 15, I never really had the chance to delve into the joy of collaborative effort
and so here I am, 4 years later, signing in once again. 

I'm a junior @ VIT Chennai, A music producer, Web/App Dev, entreprenur and startup evangelist, among a bunch of other things. 

Starting off, I'm just gonna upload documentation and whatever code I have left of my previous projects (solo or with my mates in college)

Hopefully someday in the future you're reading this as you're cloning something interesting to work with/use/learn from!
